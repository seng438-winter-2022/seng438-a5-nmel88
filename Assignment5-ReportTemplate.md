# Introduction
The purpose of this lab was to familiarize ourselves with different methods of reliability testing. Reliability growth testing was performed using ________ (SRTAT CASRE C-SFRAT SwEET). Reliability demonstration charts were used to check if MTTF is sufficient for the system's needs. The same hypothetical SUT was analyzed for each section.

# Discussion on Similarity and Differences of the Two Techniques
Reliability growth testing allows for graphical representation of reliability trends. Different models can be used to determine a best fit graph for the data. These graphs can show whether reliability is increasing, decreasing, or stable. The sample size must be quite large to allow for an accurate trend to be determined.

Reliability demonstration charts are used to determine whether the SUT is acceptable to the developer and customer using risk probabilities and failure intensity estimation. One benefit is that different levels of risk and failure intensities can easily be experimented with, as shown in the results above. However, it does not calculate the reliability of the system, only whether or not the system is acceptable to the developer and customer. The sample size does not need to be as large as the sample size for reliability growth testing.
